                    Alien Research is partially dependent on difficulty (70% on Normal; 100% Classic; 110% Brutal; 130% Impossible). As best as I can determine, this only impacts
                    the timing of Research Upgrades. It does not affect Navigator or Leader upgrades, or when an enemy first appears.

                        These upgrades will be applied to all units of this type once the associated Alien Research threshold is reached.

                    <h3>Navigator Upgrades</h3>
                    <p>
                        These upgrades have a chance of being applied to each unit of this type. There is no limit on how many units in a pod can gain these upgrades, nor is there a limit to the number
                        of upgrades an individual unit can receive. An enemy could have all of these upgrades, or none of them. It is purely up to chance. (Pod leaders are also eligible for these upgrades.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a Navigator upgrade has a 100% chance to occur, then it is functionally identical to a Research upgrade (above), except that the timing of when it occurs will not be changed
                        by the campaign's difficulty.

                    <h3>Pod Leaders</h3>
                    <p>
                        One (and only one) unit per pod will be the <strong>pod leader</strong>. In addition to improved stats and more perks, squad leaders are visibly larger than their peers, making them
                        easy to identify. The pod's leader will determine what other units can appear in the pod.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leader upgrades are cumulative, so a level 6 leader will also have the stat and perk bonuses of all prior levels. When multiple levels are possible, the leader has an equal chance of
                        rolling any of the levels. For example, if levels 0-3 are available at the current Alien Research, a leader has a 25% chance of being level 0, 1, 2, or 3. For most enemy types, a level 0
                        leader is identical to a non-leader.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Level 8 leaders can only appear during the Temple Ship Assault (the final mission), and level 9 leaders can only appear in specially scripted situations, which include certain story missions,
                        specific terror missions, late-game council missions, and alien base assaults. A detailed list will be added at a later date.
