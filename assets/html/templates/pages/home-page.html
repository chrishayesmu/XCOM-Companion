            <h1>Welcome to XCOM Companion!</h1>
            <p>You can get started by selecting a category on the left. Alternatively, search for something directly using the search box in the top left. Here's a few tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At any time, pressing Ctrl+F will focus the search box. Press enter to submit a search.</li>
                <li>If your search exactly matches a game term, or matches only one game term, you'll be sent straight there. For example, searching "xenob" will always bring you to the <in-app-link to="research_xenobiology">Xenobiology</in-app-link> research.</li>
                <li>If you're looking at an item's stats and you're not sure what a column means, hover over the image.</li>
                <li>You can go back to the last page you looked at with <strong>Mouse 4</strong>, <strong>Alt + Left Arrow</strong>, or by clicking the back arrow near the page's title.</li>
                <li>You can go forward after going back with <strong>Mouse 5</strong>, <strong>Alt + Right Arrow</strong>, or by clicking the forward arrow near the page's title.</li>
                <li>You can get back to this page by clicking the <span style="text-transform: uppercase">XCOM COMPANION</span> logo in the top left of the window.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you ever have any feedback, bug reports, or other comments, feel free to stop by the <a href="https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-Companion/issues">GitHub repo</a> and open an issue. I can also be reached on Discord at
            SwfDelicious#4905, though GitHub is preferred.</p>

                        <li>Added autocomplete suggestions while typing in the search box, for the poor souls who can't spell "Chryssalid"</li>

                            Added the <strong>Point-in-time</strong> view to enemy pages, available next to the difficulty selector. This is a view that lets you enter your current Alien Research level,
                            and see the enemy's stats at that time. You can also optionally select Navigator upgrades and Leader ranks, making it easier to see what the strongest-possible alien of a
                            given type will be.
