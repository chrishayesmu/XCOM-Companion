            <h1>Welcome to XCOM Companion!</h1>
            <p>You can get started by selecting a category on the left. Alternatively, search for something directly using the search box in the top left. Here's a few tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At any time, pressing Ctrl+F will focus the search box. Press enter to submit a search.</li>
                <li>If your search exactly matches a game term, or matches only one game term, you'll be sent straight there. For example, searching "xenob" will always bring you to the <in-app-link to="research_xenobiology">Xenobiology</in-app-link> research.</li>
                <li>If you're looking at an item's stats and you're not sure what a column means, hover over the image.</li>
                <li>You can go back to the last page you looked at with <strong>Mouse 4</strong>, <strong>Alt + Left Arrow</strong>, or by clicking the back arrow near the page's title.</li>
                <li>You can go forward after going back with <strong>Mouse 5</strong>, <strong>Alt + Right Arrow</strong>, or by clicking the forward arrow near the page's title.</li>
                <li>You can get back to this page by clicking the <span style="text-transform: uppercase">XCOM COMPANION</span> logo in the top left of the window.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you ever have any feedback, bug reports, or other comments, feel free to stop by the <a href="https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-Companion/issues">GitHub repo</a> and open an issue. I can also be reached on Discord at
            SwfDelicious, though GitHub is preferred.</p>

                    <ul>

                    <h3>Features and improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a data-page-on-click="ufo-browse-page">UFOs</a> page now groups UFOs by size, rather than being an alphabetical listing. Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-Companion/pull/18">bountygiver</a> for implementing this feature, which was requested by <a href="https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-Companion/issues/16">TheaKersh</a>.</li>
                        <li>Includes a beta version of the <a data-page-on-click="campaign-planner-page">Campaign Planner</a> tool. The beta version includes the <b>Facilities</b> and <b>Research</b> planners.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bug fixes and corrections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Corrected Harvester UFOs: they only have 3500 health, not 6000.</li>
                        <li>Build Manager: fixed a bug where new loadouts would sometimes start with items from previous loadouts of the same class.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Campaign Planner: known issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some of the UI elements don't play nice if the app is made narrow.</li>
                        <li>When creating a campaign, you select its difficulty, starting country, and a few other options. Right now there's no way to view or change what you selected, so name your campaigns well.</li>
                        <li>
                            The Facilities planner does not yet include full safeguards to stop you from putting your facilities in an impossible state; changing the campaign date and cancelling/queuing facilities
                            can allow you to do things like build the whole base without sufficient power.
                        </li>
                        <li>Similarly, there is not yet full integration between the Facilities and Research queues; you can modify your research in a way that should invalidate your facilities
                            (such as by cancelling a prerequisite research) and vice versa (cancelling labs).
                        </li>
                        <li>The model for estimating your number of scientists is based on a pretty small dataset. It has proven accurate enough for the first months of the campaign,
                            but it isn't properly validated for later on yet.
                        </li>
                        <li>There are no cool animations or anything, so the UI's a bit stiff.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Features and improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The page for Flashbang Grenades now mentions which psionic enemies are immune. (The same has not been added for Psi Grenades as I have not yet confirmed the list, but it likely matches regular Flashbangs.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bug fixes and corrections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>UFO weapon stats were showing armor penetration at 20% of their actual value, making most weapons appear much less deadly against Firestorms than their actual values. This also updates the time-to-kill and DPS values in the Air Combat page for those UFOs.</li>
                        <li>Fixed a bug on the enemy display page's point-in-time view where enemies with a sufficiently high damage stat would cause the stat box to disappear.</li>
                        <li>Corrected all dates related to Alien Research, which were off by one day. (The aliens begin the campaign with 1 research, rather than 0.)</li>
                        <li>Corrected some navigator and leader names and levels for Drones, Outsiders, EXALT units, and Muton Elites.</li>

                    <br />
                    <div>
                        A feature was mistakenly released in version 0.7.7 before it was fully ready. Version 0.7.8 brings it to a state ready for release.
                    </div>
                    <h3>Features and improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Engineering personalization: </b> when viewing items, you will now see an option to configure how many engineers, workshops, and workshop adjacencies you have (similar to the options for research).
                            If selected, this will show you the item's reduced credit cost and build time, as well as the alloy and elerium rebates to expect.
                        </li>
                        <li>(New in 0.7.8) Engineering personalization can be disabled if you wish to view the baseline item stats. This is done in the same place as entering the number of engineers, workshops, and workshop adjacencies.</li>

                    <h3>Features and improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>General: The border around input boxes (such as the search box) is finally attached to the box itself, instead of being weirdly offset up and to the left.</li>
                        <li>Build Manager: The link for the Build Manager has been moved to a new section titled "Tools", in preparation for the release of the Campaign Planner.</li>
                        <li>Enemies: The pages for Floaters and Heavy Floaters now list the research thresholds where they begin to automatically Overwatch after using Launch, in the Navigator Upgrades.</li>
                        <li>Foundry: Added the exact mechanics of how the UFO Countermeasures project is applied.</li>
                        <li>Foundry: Clarified the rate of fire improved granted by the Supercapacitors project.</li>
                        <li>Items: The Combat Stims page now includes the amount of added mobility granted by the stims' use effect (+4).</li>
                        <li>Items: The Smoke Grenade page now lists 3 known bugs for this item.</li>
                        <li>Items/Research: Pages which include info on council requests for items now include the quantity of items the council will request.</li>
                        <li>Items/Research: The council request for Alien Entertainment now mentions the size of the panic reduction it grants (-20).</li>
                        <li>UFOs: Added the research threshold at which Assault Carriers upgrade their arsenal to 2x Double Plasma.</li>
                        <li>UFOs: Added the amount of research Assault Carriers grant when successfully completing a Research mission.</li>
                        <li>UFOs: Bomb missions now include information on how damaging the UFO will reduce panic.</li>
                        <li>UFOs: The Missions section now includes a note on the bonus research granted by nearly every UFO mission.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bug fixes and corrections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Base facilities: Fixed an issue where the Satellite Nexus facility included UFO Flight Computers in its normal build cost, but not its quick build.</li>
                        <li>Base facilities: Most facilities listed the Meld cost of quick building as 10; this has been corrected to 20.</li>
                        <li>Items: The images for the Plasma Dragon and Plasma Novagun were swapped. (Thanks to <strong>Talhydras</strong> for reporting this.)</li>
                        <li>Items: Added council request data for Alien Stasis Tanks, Alien Surgeries, and Fusion Cores.</li>
                        <li>Perks: Corrected the text for Mind Merge: bonus DR for humans is (caster will / 50). Previously, and in-game, it is incorrectly listed as (caster will / 60).</li>
                        <li>Search: Fixed a bug where searches matching any of the SHIV chassis would show additional search results labeled "undefined".</li>
                        <li>Research: Corrected the text on the <a data-page-on-click="research-credits-browse-page">Interrogation Credits</a> page to note that Expertise's bonus is additive, not multiplicative,
                            and that Ethereal Interrogation only provides a 20% research bonus, not 25% like other interrogations.</li>
                        <li>Research: Updated Sectoid Commander Autopsy to remove the council request for Alien Entertainment. This request is actually unlocked by Alien Communications.</li>

                    <h3>Features and Improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a data-page-on-click="loadout-selection-page">Build Manager</a> now allows you to select Foundry projects which may impact your loadout's stats. (Most Foundry projects only unlock items for use,
                            and those are not included here; all items will be available regardless of Foundry selections.)</li>
                        <li>The Build Manager now supports creating and sharing loadouts for SHIVs! Choose your chassis, equipment, and Foundry projects to see what your SHIV can do.</li>
                        <li>The Build Manager will show how much fuel your unit has for soldiers in Archangel or Seraph armor, as well as for Hover SHIVs.</li>
                        <li>The Build Manager now correctly accounts for the 12 extra hours of fatigue imposed per officer rank.</li>
                        <li>The standalone pages for soldier perk trees, gene mods, and psi abilities have been removed, as they are now redundant with the Build Manager.
                            Since this makes Build Manager the only entry under the "Soldiers" category, that category has also been removed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bug fixes and corrections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Corrected the credits cost of the <in-app-link to="facility_elerium_generator"></in-app-link> from 200 to 400. (Thanks to <strong>Macsee</strong> for reporting this.)</li>
                        <li>Fixed (hopefully) an issue where the image for the <in-app-link to="research_gauss_weapons"></in-app-link> research failed to load. (Thanks to <strong>Macsee</strong> for reporting this.)</li>
                        <li>Fixed the UFO Air Combat page interpreting UFO weapon speed as "shots per second" when it's actually "seconds between shots", causing UFO DPS to be inflated. (This was fixed some time back for XCOM air weapons, but UFOs were missed.)</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the Build Manager allowed Scouts to equip a Marksman's Scope without checking that they were using a Marksman's Rifle.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the Build Manager was showing Sprinter's mobility bonus as part of the unit's base stats instead of in its bonuses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Known issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Build Manager does not enforce restrictions on selected equipment when changing weapon types, e.g. changing to a non-plasma weapon should unequip the Plasma Stellerator.</li>
                        <li>If a Build Manager loadout has a will malus applied (e.g. from Psi Screen), the will text is wrapping to the next line in the stats block.</li>

                        <li>Builds in the <a data-page-on-click="loadout-selection-page">Build Manager</a> are now automatically sorted by class. Within each class, builds are sorted by name.</li>

                        <li>The <in-app-link to="foundry_improved_arc_thrower"></in-app-link> page now includes the table showing capture chances before and after the project.

                        <li>Corrected the credits cost of the <in-app-link to="item_heavy_plasma_rifle"></in-app-link> from 30 to 350.</li>
                        <li>Corrected the alloy cost of the <in-app-link to="research_stealth_systems"></in-app-link> research from 30 to 0.</li>

                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a data-page-on-click="loadout-selection-page">Build Manager page</a> now supports all 8 MEC classes.
                            As MECs cannot have gene mods or psionics, nor can they be officers, builds are limited to perks and equipment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Bug fixes and corrections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed a bug in the Build Manager where importing a build with an empty item slot could cause the stat summary to fail to load.</li>

                            The <a data-page-on-click="loadout-selection-page">Build Manager page</a> now allows importing and exporting of builds.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Exporting a build gives you a long, opaque string that you can send to others.</li>
                                <li>Importing a build lets you paste that string to load an identical build into your own XCOM Companion.</li>
                                <li>Exported builds have a unique identifier in them, so that if you import the same build again, you can update the previous import.</li>
                                <li>At this time, there is no bulk import/export capability. If this is something you think you'd use, please let me know so I can prioritize appropriately.</li>

                    <h3>Bug fixes and corrections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Build Manager no longer allows selecting Neural Damping on psionically-trained soldiers. (Previously this restriction was only enforced in the other direction.)</li>

                        <li>
                            The <a data-page-on-click="loadout-selection-page">Build Manager page</a> is now available.
                            <ul>
                                <li>This page allows you to set up a soldier's perk tree, officer ranks, gene mods, psi abilities, and equipment, and get a look at what the resulting stats will be.</li>
                                <li>Currently only the 8 infantry classes are supported, with MEC support hopefully coming soon.</li>
                                <li>Most item interactions are working (e.g. you can't equip both Drum Mags and Hi-Cap Mags).</li>
                                <li>Most in-game restrictions are replicated (e.g. officers cannot be psi-trained and vice versa).</li>
                                <li>The next update will include importing and exporting builds so you can share them with others.</li>

                        <li>The <in-app-link to="enemy_outsider"></in-app-link> page was double-counting the Outsider's initial HP regen, showing 3 more regen than they actually have.</li>
                        <li>The <in-app-link to="ufo_transport" linkText="Transport UFO"></in-app-link> page showed that they contain 10 <in-app-link to="item_alien_food"></in-app-link>; they actually contain 0.</li>

                    This is just a small update. I have a few features in progress, but they'll take a while, so this might be the last update for a few weeks.

                    <h3>Minor improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The help icon on item and facility pages has been replaced with one that better fits the style of XCOM Companion, and which uses the same tooltip system as the rest of the app.</li>
                        <li>[Submitted by github.com/acp21] <a href="https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-Companion#osxlinux">README instructions</a> for running XCOM Companion on Mac and Linux have been made much more detailed, and more accessible to non-developers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bug fixes and corrections</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <in-app-link to="item_chitin_plating"></in-app-link> page was missing the 10 <in-app-link to="item_chryssalid_corpse" linkText="Chryssalid Carcasses"></in-app-link> required to build it.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where links that should open in a browser would sometimes open within XCOM Companion instead.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a data-page-on-click="map-possibilities-page">Maps page</a> now remembers which options you had selected when going forward/backwards through page history.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Other improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <in-app-link to="item_flashbang_grenade"></in-app-link> page previously listed a flat -50 Aim debuff, per UFOpaedia. However, the in-game text claims a -50% debuff, which is more consistent
                        with other effects of its type, so XCOM Companion now matches the in-game text until I can test definitively.</li>
                        <li>Changed installer to a one-click process instead of having to go through the setup wizard with every update.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added 7 maps from Enemy Unknown which were mistakenly combined with their Enemy Within counterparts when initially compiling the map database.</li>
                        <li>Fixed a bug on the Maps page that sometimes caused the list of possible maps to display twice.</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Custom research times:</strong> Now when viewing any research, in the section that displays the research time, there is a "Change" button that lets you modify the number of Scientists,
                            Laboratories, and adjacency bonuses you have. The research time will be updated to reflect your choices. These values <strong>are persisted</strong> across runs of the app, so you just need
                            to update them whenever your situation changes.
                        </li>
                        <li>The selected difficulty on the Enemy page will now be persisted between runs of XCOM Companion.</li>
                        <li>The Alien Research amount entered on the enemy point-in-time view will now be persisted between runs of XCOM Companion.</li>

                    <h3>Other improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jazzed up the XCOM COMPANION text in the top left.</li>
                        <li>Added some info on the "Ground Assault" section of UFO pages about the possibility of Terror pods on certain landings.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>[Community suggestion]</strong> The <a data-page-on-click="map-possibilities-page">Maps page</a> now grays out mission types and UFOs
                            that are incompatible with the chosen area of operations or mission type, respectively.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>[Reported by community]</strong> Fixed a bug where pages for maps (e.g. <in-app-link to="map_ufo_abductor_cliffside"></in-app-link>) broke page history navigation.</li>
                        <li>Fixed a bug in the enemy point-in-time view where the radio button for Leader Rank 0 was visually selected when loading the page (but not affecting the unit's stats).</li>

                            Added enemy data for all EXALT units: <in-app-link to="enemy_exalt_heavy"></in-app-link>, <in-app-link to="enemy_exalt_elite_heavy"></in-app-link>, <in-app-link to="enemy_exalt_medic"></in-app-link>,

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Other improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In enemy point-in-time view, if an enemy has the Mayhem perk, a warning will appear in the Damage Range section to clarify that Mayhem is not taken into account</li>
                        <li>Added some more specific info on the effects of the <in-app-link to="item_chem_grenade"></in-app-link> and <in-app-link to="item_flashbang_grenade"></in-app-link></li>

                        <li>Fixed a few instances in enemy point-in-time view where the +2 HP regen from Adaptive Bone Marrow was not reflected in the stats box</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Added autocomplete suggestions while typing in the search box, for the poor souls who can't spell "Chryssalid"</li>
                        <li>Fixed: If searching for a term which has multiple exact matches (e.g. Scout, both a class and a UFO type), search now leads to a disambiguation page</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Other changes</h3>
                    <ul>

                        <li>
                            Added the <strong>Point-in-time</strong> view to enemy pages, available next to the difficulty selector. This is a view that lets you enter your current Alien Research level,
                            and see the enemy's stats at that time. You can also optionally select Navigator upgrades and Leader ranks, making it easier to see what the strongest-possible alien of a
                            given type will be.
                        </li>

                            Added first version of enemy info pages (ex: <in-app-link to="enemy_mechtoid"></in-app-link>). This is a functional but basic feature that will be getting more updates in the near future.
