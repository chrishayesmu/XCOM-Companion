            <h1>Welcome to XCOM Companion!</h1>
            <p>You can get started by selecting a category on the left. Alternatively, search for something directly using the search box in the top left. Here's a few tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At any time, pressing Ctrl+F will focus the search box. Press enter to submit a search.</li>
                <li>If your search exactly matches a game term, or matches only one game term, you'll be sent straight there. For example, searching "xenob" will always bring you to the <a data-page-on-click="tech-details-page" data-pagearg-tech-id="research_xenobiology">Xenobiology</a> research.</li>
                <li>If you're looking at an item's stats and you're not sure what a column means, hover over the image.</li>
                <li>You can go back to the last page you looked at with <strong>Mouse 4</strong>, <strong>Alt + Left Arrow</strong>, or by clicking the back arrow near the page's title.</li>
                <li>You can go forward after going back with <strong>Mouse 5</strong>, <strong>Alt + Right Arrow</strong>, or by clicking the forward arrow near the page's title.</li>
                <li>You can get back to this page by clicking the <span style="text-transform: uppercase">XCOM COMPANION</span> logo in the top left of the window.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you ever have any feedback, bug reports, or other comments, feel free to stop by the <a href="https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-Companion/issues">GitHub repo</a> and open an issue.</p>
